productDes1="Robinson Crusoe is fond of adventure. He is passionate about sailing the seas and seeing new places. He gives up his passion because of two dangerous sea voyages. However, after a while he goes on a journey again. The ship he is traveling on sinks. Only he is saved. He starts life on a deserted island. He builds a shelter for himself. He tames wild goats. He cultivates the land. The diaries he kept there will also form the subject of his novel.

An event that Robinson experienced in the middle of his twenty-fourth year on the island changed the shape of his life. Unexpected guests come to the island. He fights with them and manages to detain one of the captives with them. He is no longer alone on the island. He gives the man the name of the day he caught him. They start calling him Friday. It educates him.

After a while, a riot breaks out on a ship around the island. He takes advantage of this and takes over the ship. Robinson Crusoe, who spent most of his 54-year life away from his homeland in pursuit of adventure, eventually returns to his country, England. Despite all these experiences, his passion for adventure never ends."
productDes2="In 1866, many ships sank at sea for unknown reasons. Everyone thinks this thing is a monster. A group is formed to find out what this thing that sinks ships is. The group also includes French scientist Arannox and his assistant. They set out to do research on the ship named Abraham Lincon.
When the ship approaches Japan, they encounter something in the water. Although they try to catch it, they are counter-attacked and Aronnox and a few others fall from the ship onto the thing that attacked them. Contrary to what everyone thinks, this thing that sank their ships is not a monster but a submarine.
Arannox and his companions are taken into the submarine. The captain of this submarine is a man named Nemo, and he explained that he and the people on the ship went out to explore the seas, away from society, and if anyone attacked them, they sank them. He wants the delegation to see that they are now captives on the ship, but he wants them to see the new things they have discovered. Although Arronnox did not like this situation at first, he saw many different things that he had never known before in his life. They discovered poles and corals and many different places. But they are still prisoners there.
During their journey, captain Nemo and his crew sink whatever attacks them. The delegation makes a plan to find a way to escape from there. Captain Nemo also attacks a ship and causes the people there to die. This makes him very sad and decides to quit his job. Our delegation starts to escape with a lifeboat they have dismantled, but they cannot stand it for long due to the waves in the sea and they topple over. When Aronnox opens his eyes, he is on an island, but some of his friends are gone."

Nikolay is a reformist who shared his land with the villagers. He lives on the farm with his older brother Pavel Petrovich and a young lady who has a class difference with him.

After the young people come to the farm, the traditionalist father and uncle often argue about the young people's nihilist (nothingness) ideas. Bazarov is a medically educated person, and draws the thunder of Uncle Pavel by saying that the purpose of science is above emotion and tradition and that he does not recognize any authority. Bazarov does not even take these discussions into consideration and conducts experiments and research related to his profession. The two young people meet Anna Sergeyevna Odintsova at the ball they attend. The two friends are amazed by the woman's beauty and intelligence. Odintsova is also impressed by Bazarov's courage to believe in nothing and invites them to her house. Odintsova, who lives with her sister Katya, is a widow. She lives luxuriously with her husband's inheritance and is a woman who attaches importance to order. After a while, Bazarov falls in love with Anna and Arkady falls in love with Katya."
productDes4="Once upon a time, in ancient times, there lived an old toymaker named Geppetto. He made a living by making and selling wooden toys. He has never had a child and all he wants is to have one. He went to the forest and said he would find a beautiful tree and make a wonderful toy from it. He created Pinocchio from the log he took from the forest. He didn't even realize he was alive when he heard voices. Pinocchio was now shaped and while cleaning the surroundings, he heard the voice "hello". He heard Pinocchio moving and talking. He was surprised when he saw him and said, "The boy is exactly what I wanted." He was not flesh and blood, but he was alive and now he had a child he could love. He named it Pinocchio.

Master Geppetto gave money for Pinocchio to go to school. On his way to school, he stopped by the circus show on the streets with curiosity. While he was looking inside, his owner suddenly caught him. He was very happy to see the puppet moving without strings and thought he could make a lot of money from it. The fairy godmother went to Pinocchio and said, "I will save you from here, but don't break your father's word again."

Master Geppetto was very worried that Pinocchio would not return home. He went out to the streets and looked for himself. Then he found Pinocchio aside and said, "Son, I am your father." They were very happy to see each other. Pinocchio never disobeyed his father's words again. He learned never to lie to his father, knowing that if he lied, his nose would grow."
